            <h1>Home-School Communication</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>Orientation</h2>
            <p>Before the school year begins, each family will receive information in August that includes an
                orientation day for families. This visiting day allows the child and parent(s) to visit the classroom
                and meet the teachers and classmates. This visit is one hour long. It will allow
                time for the child to enjoy free play and also give parent(s) a brief overview of what to expect
                during the school year. The next day, a child will attend school on his/her own. The class is
                divided in half, attending on two different days. This schedule allows the children and
                teachers to interact with a small group before the entire class attends at the end of the first
                week.</p>
            <h2>Parent-Staff Communication</h2>
            <p>Communication is ongoing throughout the year. Newsletters, the school website, and emails
                give you information on current themes, activities, and upcoming events. Phone calls and/or
                emails by classroom teachers to discuss your childâ€™s adjustment, observations, and/or
                concerns are common. If you feel you need to speak to a teacher or the director, please email
                or call the office. Teachers can be reached by phone or email after the school day is over. </p>
            <h2>Parent-Teacher Conferences</h2>
            <p>The school has two Parent Conferences during the school year. The fall conference is an
                informal, getting-to-know-the-child-and-family discussion that includes a written conference
                summary. The spring conference includes a more detailed, written developmental
                assessment. A parent-teacher conference can be scheduled at any time during the year as
                needed and by request of parents and/or teachers.</p>
