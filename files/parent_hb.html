            about WUNS’ preschool philosophy, staff, curriculum, classrooms,
            events, and policies and procedures.

            Encouragement and pride in self is the basis of our discipline policy. Our aim is to have the children manage their own actions and reactions. The teachers and staff will help children learn and develop skills that they need to display appropriate behavior. This is done through:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Positive reinforcement.</li>
            <li>Anticipating unhealthy social interaction.</li>
            <li>Re-direction: guiding a child toward appropriate, socially positive activities.</li>
            <li>Naming and validating child’s feelings.</li>
            <li>Expressing disappointment or disapproval in a respectful and constructive manner.</li>
            <li>Simple, logical and immediate consequences.</li>
        </ul>

      <button class="accordion">Orientation</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
            Before the school year begins, each family will receive information in August that includes an
            orientation day for families. This visiting day allows the child and parent(s) to visit the classroom
            and meet the teachers and classmates. This visit is one hour long. It will allow
            time for the child to enjoy free play and also give parent(s) a brief overview of what to expect
            during the school year. The next day, a child will attend school on his/her own. The class is
            divided in half, attending on two different days. This schedule allows the children and
            teachers to interact with a small group before the entire class attends at the end of the first
            week.

            The school has two Parent Conferences during the school year. The fall conference is an
            informal, getting-to-know-the-child-and-family discussion that includes a written conference
            summary. The spring conference includes a more detailed, written developmental
            assessment. A parent-teacher conference can be scheduled at any time during the year as
            needed and by request of parents and/or teachers.
