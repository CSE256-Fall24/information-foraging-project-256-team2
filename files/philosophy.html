                        Washington University Nursery School teachers are attentive to individual needs, serving as
                        catalysts to spark each child’s interests and desire to experiment and explore. Our school
                        provides a safe, nurturing environment that encourages growth and independence in all
                        developmental areas.
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The philosophy of the nursery school is that children learn most effectively through play. Our
                        approach is “hands-on,” where children act upon what they are learning and feeling. We consider
                        the process more important than the product. Teachers provide the opportunity for children to
                        interact with their environment in ways that are meaningful to them. For each class, teachers
                        develop a curriculum that reflects the interests and abilities of the children in the classroom.
                        In addition, all children actively participate with specialists in science, art, music and
                        Spanish. As trends in the field of early education change, we evaluate what is new and determine
                        if it would be enriching for our program.
