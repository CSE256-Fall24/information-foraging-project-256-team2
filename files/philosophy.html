                        The staff and director at WUNS work to maintain a very positive and nurturing environment for each child.
                        Classroom limits are necessary to provide a sense of order and allow teachers to spend as much time as possible
                        providing a stimulating environment for each child. Our rule of thumb is that children keep themselves safe, 
                        keep friends safe, and the toys at school safe.

                        Individualization

                    <p>
                        Washington University Nursery School teachers are attentive to individual needs, serving as
                        catalysts to spark each child’s interests and desire to experiment and explore. Our school
                        provides a safe, nurturing environment that encourages growth and independence in all
                        developmental areas. For each class, teachers develop a curriculum that reflects the interests
                        and abilities of the children in the classroom.

                    <h2>
                        Hands-on Learning
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The philosophy of the nursery school is that children learn most effectively through play. Our
                        approach is “hands-on,” where children act upon what they are learning and feeling. We consider
                        the process more important than the product. Teachers provide the opportunity for children to
                        interact with their environment in ways that are meaningful to them.
                        In addition, all children actively participate with specialists in science, art, music and
                        Spanish. As trends in the field of early education change, we evaluate what is new and determine
                        if it would be enriching for our program.
