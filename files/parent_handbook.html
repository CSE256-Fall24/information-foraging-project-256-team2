      <h2>
        Individualization
      </h2>
      <p>
          Washington University Nursery School teachers are attentive to individual needs, serving as
          catalysts to spark each child’s interests and desire to experiment and explore. Our school
          provides a safe, nurturing environment that encourages growth and independence in all
          developmental areas. For each class, teachers develop a curriculum that reflects the interests
          and abilities of the children in the classroom.
      </p>
      <h2>
          Hands-on Learning
      </h2>
      <p>
          The philosophy of the nursery school is that children learn most effectively through play. Our
          approach is “hands-on,” where children act upon what they are learning and feeling. We consider
          the process more important than the product. Teachers provide the opportunity for children to
          interact with their environment in ways that are meaningful to them.
          In addition, all children actively participate with specialists in science, art, music and
          Spanish. As trends in the field of early education change, we evaluate what is new and determine
          if it would be enriching for our program.

          Discipline
      </h2>
      <p>
        Encouragement	and	pride	in	self	is	the	basis	of	our	discipline	policy.	Our	aim	is	to	have	the	
        children	manage	their	own	actions	and	reactions.	The	teachers	and	staff	will	help	children	
        learn	and	develop	skills	that	they	need	to	display	appropriate	behavior.			This	is	done	
        through:
        <ul>
        <li>Positive	reinforcement.</li>
        <li>Anticipating	unhealthy	social	interaction.</li>
        <li>Re-direction:		guiding	a	child	toward	appropriate,	socially	positive	activities.</li>
        <li>Naming	and	validating	child’s	feelings.</li>
        <li>Expressing	disappointment	or	disapproval	in a	respectful	and	constructive	manner.</li>
        <li>Simple,	logical	and	immediate	consequences.</li>
        </ul>
