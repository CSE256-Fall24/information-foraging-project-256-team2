          <strong class="subhead">About Our Program</strong>
          <p>
            Designed for children ages two and a half to five years, our summer
            camp program includes a wide range of creative indoor and outdoor 
            activities, with time to explore and discover, play and make 
            friends. Since a good number of hours are spent outside during 
            summer camp, the nursery school playground provides opportunities to 
            cool off with outdoor water play that includes troughs, sprinklers 
            and hoses. Building in the sand and playing on the climbing 
            equipment are two other favorite outdoor activities. An adjoining 
            wading pool is available for summer campers, whether enrolled in the 
            swimming classes or not. Children bring their own lunches. Camp 
            provides a morning snack.
            <br>
            <b>Bear Tracks:</b> Extended day program offered; involves afternoon play
            with mixed-age children. Children must be toilet trained to attend. See below 
            for additional tuition costs.
