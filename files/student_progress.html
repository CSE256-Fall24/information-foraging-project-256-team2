        <p>The teachers at Washington University Nursery School observe and assess children’s progress on an ongoing basis. Teachers consistently plan and adapt experiences within the curriculum to meet students’ needs.</p>

        <p>If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety of ways, which may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking process, build trust, and increase student confidence</li>
            <li>Offering more opportunities for exploration</li>
            <li>Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli</li>
            <li>Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration</li>
            <li>Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process</li>
            <li>Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular concept, skill, or area of concern</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year (Fall and Spring). Teachers take note of students’ activities throughout the year in order to learn about each child, plan for individual and group needs, and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis. The Fall conference is informal – teachers meet with parents, relate to them the activities and progress of their child, and answer any questions they may have regarding their child’s learning experiences.</p>
        
        <p>The Spring conference is more formal – teachers fill out an assessment form covering all areas of the curriculum, including personal observations, in order to provide a well-rounded picture of each child. The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that parents have time to read and understand the material, and form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting.</p>
