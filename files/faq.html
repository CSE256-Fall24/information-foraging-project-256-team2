            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            <br>
            <h3>1. I think my child might need extra help. How does the Washington University Nursery School staff
                ensure my child receives the support they need?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety of ways,
                including one on one time with the teacher and sensory exploration. Read more about our approach to
                individualized support in the <a class="download" href="downloads/curriculum_overview.pdf">Curriculum
                    Overview</a></p>
            <br>
            <h3>2. I want to stay updated on my child's growth and learning. Are there parent teacher conferences or
                other forms of communication offered by the Washington University Nursery School?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The school has two Parent Conferences during the school year, one in the Fall and one in the Spring.
                Additional conferences may be scheduled
                as needed.</p>
            <p>Communication is delivered in multiple formats throughout the year. You can stay updated on the school's
                events and activities through the school's website, newsletters, and emails.</p>
            <p>To learn more about how we communicate with parents, please refer to the Parent-Staff Communication and

            <h3>How is discipline incorporated into the Washington University Nursery School?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The staff and director at WUNS work to maintain a very positive and nurturing environment for each child.
                Classroom limits are necessary to provide a sense of order and allow teachers to spend as much time as
                possible providing a stimulating environment for each child. The staff is trained to anticipate
                potentially problematic situations; they remind children of appropriate behavior and redirect or
                intervene when necessary. Read more about our philosophy on discpline in the <a class="download"
